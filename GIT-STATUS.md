## 🚀 How to Push (Multiple Options)

### Option 1: GitHub CLI (Recommended)

```bash
cd /home/user/webapp

# Install GitHub CLI if not already installed
# Then authenticate
gh auth login

# Push commits
git push origin main
```

### Option 2: Personal Access Token (Classic)

1. **Create Token:**
   - Go to https://github.com/settings/tokens
   - Click "Generate new token (classic)"
   - Select scopes: `repo` (full control)
   - Generate and copy the token

2. **Push with Token:**
```bash
cd /home/user/webapp

# Replace YOUR_TOKEN with your actual token
git push https://x-access-token:YOUR_TOKEN@github.com/Goodboycat/Pixel-Particle-Recorder.git main
```

### Option 3: Set up Credential Helper with Token

```bash
cd /home/user/webapp

# Store credentials (will prompt for username and token)
git config credential.helper store

# Push (will ask for credentials once, then save them)
git push origin main
# Username: Goodboycat
# Password: <paste your token>
```

### Option 4: Clone and Copy (If Above Fails)

```bash
# On your local machine
git clone https://github.com/Goodboycat/Pixel-Particle-Recorder.git
cd Pixel-Particle-Recorder

# Copy all files from sandbox to here, then:
git add -A
git commit -m "Update from sandbox development"
git push origin main
```

- **GitHub Pages:** https://goodboycat.github.io/Pixel-Particle-Recorder/

(You may need to enable GitHub Pages in Settings → Pages)

---

## ⚠️ Troubleshooting

### "Authentication failed"
- You're using password (deprecated)
- Solution: Use Personal Access Token as password

### "fatal: could not read Username"
- Credential helper needs manual input
- Solution: Use Option 2 (push with full URL + token)

### "Permission denied"
- Token doesn't have `repo` scope
- Solution: Create new token with `repo` checked

### "Repository not found"
- Token expired or revoked
- Solution: Generate new token

---

## 💡 Quick Command (With Token)

Replace `YOUR_TOKEN` and run:

```bash
cd /home/user/webapp && \
git push https://x-access-token:YOUR_TOKEN@github.com/Goodboycat/Pixel-Particle-Recorder.git main
```
