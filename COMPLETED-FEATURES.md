### ✅ Feature 2: Split Effects into Individual Files (COMPLETE)
**Status:** ✅ All 8 Effects Separated

Each effect is now in its own dedicated file for easy maintenance and customization.

**Files Created:**
- `js/effects/explosion.js` - 💥 Explosion effect
- `js/effects/fireworks.js` - 🎆 Fireworks effect
- `js/effects/spiral.js` - 🌀 Spiral effect
- `js/effects/vortex.js` - 🌪️ Vortex effect
- `js/effects/lightning.js` - ⚡ Lightning effect
- `js/effects/snow.js` - ❄️ Snow effect
- `js/effects/hearts.js` - 💖 Hearts effect
- `js/effects/confetti.js` - 🎊 Confetti effect

**Benefits:**
- 📁 Easy to find and edit specific effects
- 🔄 Can add/remove effects without touching other code
- 👥 Multiple people can work on different effects
- 📦 Cleaner project structure

---

### ✅ Feature 3: Auto-Load Effect System (COMPLETE)
**Status:** ✅ Fully Functional

Dynamic system that automatically detects effects and creates UI buttons.

**Files Created:**
- `js/core/EffectLoader.js` - Auto-loading system

**How It Works:**
1. Each effect file registers itself with `effectLoader.registerEffect()`
2. EffectLoader tracks all registered effects
3. App.js queries EffectLoader for available effects
4. Buttons are automatically generated with icons and names
5. Adding new effect = just drop file in folder + add `<script>` tag

**Auto-Registration Code in Each Effect:**
```javascript
if (typeof effectLoader !== 'undefined') {
    effectLoader.registerEffect('effectName', effectFunction);
}
```

**What This Means:**
- ➕ Add new effect → reload → button appears automatically
- 🎨 Each effect gets appropriate emoji icon
- 📝 Display names are auto-formatted (camelCase → Title Case)
- 🔌 True plug-and-play system

---

### ✅ Feature 4: Continuous Mode for All Effects (COMPLETE)
**Status:** ✅ Works with Every Effect (Including External Ones)

Universal continuous mode that makes ANY effect repeat like emitters.

**Files Created:**
- `js/core/ContinuousMode.js` - Continuous repetition system

**What Works:**
- ☑️ Toggle checkbox to enable/disable continuous mode
- 🔁 Any effect button clicked repeats every second
- ⏹️ "Stop All Continuous" button clears all repeating effects
- 🆕 Works with effects added externally (future effects automatically supported)
- 🎛️ Configurable repeat interval

**How to Use:**
1. Check "🔁 Continuous Mode" checkbox
2. Click any effect button
3. Effect repeats automatically every 1 second
4. Click "⏹️ Stop All Continuous" to stop

**Technical Details:**
- Uses JavaScript `setInterval()` for timing
- Tracks all active continuous effects
- Automatically cleans up when disabled
- Works with any effect registered in EffectLoader
- Zero modification needed for external effects
