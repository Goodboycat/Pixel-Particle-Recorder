## üîê How to Push (Manual Method)

Since the sandbox doesn't have GitHub credentials, you'll need to push manually:

### Option 1: Using GitHub Personal Access Token

1. **Clone the repository on your local machine:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Goodboycat/Pixel-Particle-Recorder.git
   cd Pixel-Particle-Recorder
   ```

2. **Copy the commit from sandbox:**
   - The commit `df3dbeb` is ready
   - All changes are committed locally in the sandbox

3. **Pull the latest commit from the sandbox:**
   ```bash
   # If you have access to the sandbox files, copy them over
   # Or manually recreate the changes based on this document
   ```

4. **Push to GitHub:**
   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```

### Option 2: Direct File Download Method

1. Download these files from the sandbox:
   - All files in `/home/user/webapp/js/core/` (3 new files)
   - All files in `/home/user/webapp/js/effects/` (8 new files)
   - `index.html`, `js/app.js`, `css/main.css`, `README.md`

2. On your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Goodboycat/Pixel-Particle-Recorder.git
   cd Pixel-Particle-Recorder
   # Copy the downloaded files over existing files
   git add .
   git commit -m "üé® Major Update: Recorder System + Modular Effects + Continuous Mode"
   git push origin main
   ```

### Option 3: Use GitHub CLI

If you have GitHub CLI installed:

```bash
# Authenticate
