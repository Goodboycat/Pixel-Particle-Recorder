# 🚀 How to Push to GitHub

Your code is ready and committed! Here's how to push it to GitHub:

## Option 1: Use Personal Access Token (Recommended)

1. **Go to GitHub** → Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens → Tokens (classic)
2. **Generate new token** with `repo` scope
3. **Copy the token**
4. **Run these commands:**

```bash
cd /home/user/webapp

# Push with token (replace YOUR_TOKEN with your actual token)
git push https://YOUR_TOKEN@github.com/Goodboycat/Pixel-Particle-Recorder.git main
```

## Option 2: Use GitHub CLI

```bash
# Install GitHub CLI (if not installed)
# Then authenticate and push
gh auth login
git push origin main
```

## Option 3: From Local Machine

If you're working on your local machine:

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/Goodboycat/Pixel-Particle-Recorder.git

# Copy files manually, then:
git add -A
git commit -m "Updated particle system"
git push origin main
```
